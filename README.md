Employee attrition is a significant challenge for organizations, impacting productivity, morale, and recruitment costs. Machine learning can predict attrition by analyzing factors like job satisfaction, performance, compensation, and tenure. By using classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests), these models help HR teams identify at-risk employees early. This allows for proactive retention strategies such as personalized interventions, employee engagement initiatives, and improved work culture. Leveraging data-driven insights, organizations can reduce turnover, optimize workforce planning, and enhance overall business performance.










## **ðŸ“„Description**
- Models Used: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) were employed for HR attrition prediction.
- Features Analyzed: soem features where dropped and some where analysed, for better prediction
- Model Evaluation: Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Best Performing Model: Logistic Regression was found to be the most accurate and interpretable model for predicting employee attrition.
 Logistic Regression was selected as the best model for predicting employee attrition in this project.
